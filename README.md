Insurance Claim Prediction  

Overview  

The Insurance Claim Prediction project uses machine learning models to predict whether an insurance claim will be approved or rejected based on customer and policy-related data. This project helps insurance companies streamline the claims process by identifying high-risk claims, reducing fraud, and improving customer satisfaction.
